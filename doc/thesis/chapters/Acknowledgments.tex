% This is all started when my supervisor, Tijs van der Storm, provided us with the classic Aspect Oriented Programming paper during our software construction course of this Master's program.
% I was always thinking that crosscutting concerns is a problem of modularity and code cloning, scattering was annoying and I knew this was bad, but I never knew its name.
% But then the Aspect Oriented Programming paper explained it to me explicitly.
% First thing was to go to Tijs and ask him if AOP really works since I was not really convinced.
% How can no one use this technique if it really works?
% Tijs then explained to me that he and William R. Cook worked together on something different, that would solve that problem in a different way, the Managed Data.
% That day I left from his office with a list of papers discussing AOP and of course Managed Data.
% I've started implement it in Java right away in order to see if it actually works.
% Well, it worked, and I got very excited.
% This was the time I knew to do this.

% For this thesis, first I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Tijs van der Storm, my supervisor who introduced me to this idea.
% Tijs was a great inspiration for me from the first time.
% He helped me with every single problem I faced during this process.
% I will never forget the bootstraping process, Tijs had the patience to explain it to me a number of times, it was always mind-blowing, until I understand it.
% Additionally I want to thank Tijs because he was a real inspiration for me on his way of thinking and of course perfectionism. 
% He changed my way of programming and thinking about programming completely.

% Moreover, I would like to thank my colleagues and friends from CWI for the interesting and inspiring conversations.
% However, my biggest support was from Ifigeneia.
% The writing of this thesis would never be complete if she was not on my side.
% I express my thanks to Ifigeneia for her constant help, inspiration and the interest she showed on the subject during its completion.

% \section{Schema}

% \subsection{Description of Schema}
% % A class has a name and a list of fields, each of which ha a name and a type 

% \subsection{Schema Schema}

% \subsection{Metadata}
% % Inverse fields 
% % – parent/child, instructor/course, etc 
% % – automatically maintained 
% % Field properties 
% % – key: ensures uniqueness in context 
% % – traversal: ensures reachability 
% % – ordering: ordered/unordered collections 
% % Invariants 
% % – field.type = field.inverse.owner  

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \section{Factories}
% % Manages data described by a schema 

% % Interpreted 
% % – Virtual object has fields specified by schema 
% % – Ensures data is valid with respect to schema 

% % Multiple interpretations

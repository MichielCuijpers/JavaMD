\subsubsection{Schemas Definition}\label{Schema Definition}
% % A class has a name and a list of fields, each of which ha a name and a type 

% interfaces
% annotations

% \subsection{Metadata}
% Inverse fields 
% – parent/child, instructor/course, etc 
% – automatically maintained 
% Field properties 
% – key: ensures uniqueness in context 
% – traversal: ensures reachability 
% – ordering: ordered/unordered collections 
% Invariants 
% – field.type = field.inverse.owner  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Schema Factories}\label{Schema Factories}
% interfaces

% Constructors
% Initialization values
% Limitations

\section{Managed Objects}\label{sec:Managed Objects}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Data Managers Definition}\label{Data Managers Definition}
% Dynamic proxies
% Decorator pattern to stack them

% Manages data described by a schema 

% Interpreted 
% – Virtual object has fields specified by schema 
% – Ensures data is valid with respect to schema 

% Multiple interpretations

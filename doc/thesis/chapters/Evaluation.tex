\section{Research Questions and Answers}\label{Research Questions and Answers}
In Chapter \ref{Introduction} we stated three research questions that were the main focus of this thesis.
Up to this point we must be able to answer all of them as follows:

\paragraph{Can managed data be implemented in a static language?}\mbox{}\\
...

\paragraph{Can managed data solve the problem of crosscutting concerns?}\mbox{}\\
...

\paragraph{To what extent can managed data tame an inventory of aspects and design patterns in the JHotDraw framework, compared to the original and the \ac{aop} implementation?}\mbox{}\\
...

\section{Threads to Validity}
% all study designs have flaws. By acknowledging them explicitly, the researchers show that they are aware of the flaws and have taken reasonable steps to minimize their effects.

% Construct Validity: Efficient intepretation of the results 
% Internal validity: Study design
% External validity: Justified results (is it the right case?)
% Reliability validity: same results on replication?
